        <h2>Why I prefer Dogs over Cats</h2>
        <p>I prefer dogs over cats because I think that dogs are way more fun than cats. Most dogs are a lot more active than cats and I am an active person. Dogs love to play a ton of games to get their energy going suck as fetch. They also love to run around and are just so cute!</p>
